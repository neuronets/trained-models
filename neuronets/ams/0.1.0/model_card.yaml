  Motivation: "To develop a robust model for meningioma segmentation in diverse clinical scenarios."
  Preprocessing: "Standardized image processing, conforming to 256 slices with 1mm3 isotropic voxels."

Training Data:
  Datasets: "Dataset of 10099 high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans of healthy brains and 806 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted meningioma MRIs."
  Motivation: "To create a reliable model for meningioma segmentation, capable of generalizing across various MRI types and tumor characteristics."
  Preprocessing: "MRI scans conformed to standard dimensions, tumors segmented by experts for training."
