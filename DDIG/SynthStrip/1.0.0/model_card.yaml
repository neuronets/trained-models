Intended_use:
  Primary_intended_uses: "Skull-stripping in various imaging modalities, resolutions, and subject populations."
  Primary_intended_users: "Researchers and practitioners in medical imaging."
  Out_of_scope_use_cases: "Non-medical image processing, applications outside brain imaging."

Factors:
  Relevant_factors: "Image quality, resolution, imaging modalities (MRI, CT, PET), subject age and health condition (infants to adults, including glioblastoma patients)"
  Evaluation_factors: "Robustness to variations in imaging conditions, accuracy of brain voxel extraction."
  Model_performance_measures: "Accuracy in brain voxel extraction, compatibility with different imaging modalities."

Metrics:
  Model Performance Measures: "Accuracy in skull-stripping across different imaging modalities and subject conditions."
  Decision Thresholds: "Thresholds for voxel classification as brain or non-brain tissue."
  Variation Approaches: "Adaptation to different imaging conditions and subject demographics."

Evaluation Data:
  Datasets: "622 MRI, CT, and PET scans with corresponding ground-truth brain masks."
  Motivation: "To evaluate performance across diverse imaging types and subject populations."
  Preprocessing: "Standardization of image formats and resolution normalization."

Training Data:
  Datasets: "131 adult MPRAGE scans with FreeSurfer brain labels and additional non-brain labels."
  Motivation: "To create a robust model capable of accurately segmenting brain tissue in diverse imaging contexts."
  Preprocessing: "Segmentation map synthesis, resolution normalization, data augmentation for robustness."

Quantitative Analyses:
  Unitary Results: "Performance metrics for individual modalities and subject conditions."
  Intersectional Results: "Analysis across combinations of imaging modalities and subject demographics."

Ethical Considerations:
  "Consideration of patient privacy and data security, especially given the sensitive nature of medical imaging data."

Caveats and Recommendations:
  "Users should be aware of the model's limitations in extreme imaging conditions. Continuous validation with new data is recommended to maintain performance accuracy."
